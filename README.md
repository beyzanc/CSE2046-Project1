# CSE2046-Project1
The project which is given in CSE2046- Analysis of Algorithms. The aim of the project is to design an experiment to compare different algorithms for the selection problem, i.e. finding k-th smallest element in an unsorted list of n numbers. In this experiment, we are going to compare seven methods and we will analyze our results both theoretically and empirically.
